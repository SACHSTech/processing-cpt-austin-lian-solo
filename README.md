## Core Concepts <a name="core-concepts"></a>

1. **Facility Management**
   - **Facility**: Players manage a facility that houses various anomalies, each with unique behaviors and needs.
   - **Containment**: Ensuring that anomalies are properly contained to prevent breaches and maintain safety within the facility.
2. **Resource Allocation**
   - **Energy Generation**: Players extract energy from anomalies, which is used as the primary resource for progression.
   - **Resource Management**: Balancing the use of resources to upgrade facilities, hire and train employees, and handle emergencies.
3. **Employee Management**
   - **Hiring and Training**: Players recruit and train employees, each with different stats and abilities.
   - **Assignments**: Assigning employees to interact with anomalies, conduct research, and handle crises.
4. **Risk and Reward**
   - **Risk Management**: Balancing the benefits of interacting with anomalies against the risks of potential breaches or employee harm.
   - **Decision Making**: Making strategic decisions that impact the safety and efficiency of the facility.

## Mechanics <a name="mechanics"></a>

1. **Anomaly Interactions**
   - **Tasks**: Assign employees to perform tasks such as insight, instinct, attachment, and repression with anomalies.
   - **Anomaly Behavior**: Each anomaly has specific reactions and behaviors that players must learn and manage effectively.
2. **Crisis Management**
   - **Emergencies**: Handling breaches, employee casualties, and other emergencies that arise from anomalies.
   - **Containment Protocols**: Implementing measures to recapture escaped anomalies and restore order.
3. **Progression System**
   - **Research and Development**: Conducting research to unlock new technologies, upgrades, and information about anomalies.
   - **Facility Expansion**: Expanding the facility with new containment units, departments, and capabilities as players progress.
4. **Employee Well-being**
   - **Mental Health**: Monitoring and maintaining the mental health of employees to prevent breakdowns and improve performance.
   - **Physical Health**: Ensuring employees recover from injuries and are equipped to handle the demands of the job.

## Gameplay Loop <a name="gameplay-loop"></a>

1. **Day-to-Day Operations**
   - Start each day by planning and assigning tasks to employees.
   - Interact with anomalies to extract energy while managing risks.
   - Handle any crises that arise throughout the day.
2. **End-of-Day Review**
   - Review the dayâ€™s performance, including energy collected, employee status, and any incidents.
   - Make strategic decisions on upgrades, hiring, and resource allocation for the next day.
3. **Long-term Strategy**
   - Develop a long-term strategy for facility growth, anomaly management, and employee development.
   - Progress through increasingly difficult challenges as the facility expands and more complex anomalies are introduced.
