 **Facility Management**

- **Facility**: Players manage a facility that houses various anomalies, each with unique behaviors and needs.
- **Containment**: Ensuring that anomalies are properly contained to prevent breaches and maintain safety within the facility.

## Mechanics <a name="mechanics"></a>

 **Anomaly Interactions**

- **Tasks**: Can perform tasks such as Instinct and Repression.

## How to win/lose <a name="How to win/lose"></a>
